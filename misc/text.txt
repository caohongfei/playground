Flagships, Feeders, and the Texas
Top 10% Law: A Test of the
"Brain Drain" Hypothesis
Affirmative action came under assault during the
mid 1990s with the passage of Proposition 209 in California, the 1996
Hopwood v. University of Texas decision in Texas, and the enactment of
Initiative 200 in Washington. In response to the judicial ban on the use
of race-sensitive criteria in college admissions decisions, in 1997 the
Texas legislature passed H.B. 588-popularly known as the top 10%
law-guaranteeing automatic admission to any public university to high
school students who graduate in the top decile of their class (Texas
Higher Education Coordinating Board [THECB], 1998). Building on extensive
empirical evidence that high school grades are strong predictors
of college success (Bowen & Bok, 1998) and the philosophical principle
of equal educational opportunity (Coleman, 1990; Jencks, 1988), the architects
of H.B. 588 sought to maintain the hard-won ethno-racial diversity
at the public flagship universities.
The top 10% law changed the terms of the debate about merit and access
to the state's most selective public institutions. Affirmative action
was criticized for privileging allegedly underqualified minority students
for admission to the most competitive postsecondary institutions; the top
10% law is criticized for giving students from underperforming schools
this unfair advantage (Flores, 2003; Glater, 2004; Nissimov, 2003). In

effect, the terms of exclusion changed from members of minority groups
(Blacks and Hispanics, specifically) to underperforming schools.
Notwithstanding the appeal of a merit-based admission policy that is
applied uniformly across high schools, H.B. 588 has become as controversial
as the race-sensitive admission regime it replaced (Flores, 2003;
Glater, 2004; Nissimov, 2000). Many salutary consequences have played
themselves out, but so too have unanticipated difficulties. On the positive
side of the ledger, early results indicated that the law had some capacity
to restore ethno-racial diversity at the state's public flagships
(Tienda, Leicht, Sullivan, Maltese, & Lloyd, 2003; University of Texas
Office of Public Affairs [UTOPA], 2003; Walker & Lavergne, 2001).
Additional benefits include greater geographic diversity of incoming
students (Montejano, 2001), stronger institutional ties between secondary
schools and the public flagships via expanded outreach efforts
(Goodman, 2003), and additional evidence that class rank is a more reliable
predictor of college success than are standardized test scores
(Faulkner, 2000, 2002; Glater, 2004; Rooney, 1998; Walker & Lavergne,
2001). When the outcome of the Michigan litigation (Grutter v.
Bollinger, 2003; Gratz v. Bollinger, 2003) was uncertain, these promising
early results were widely celebrated.
On the negative side of the ledger, most concerns center on institutional
saturation with top decile graduates and growing anxiety that
graduates from highly competitive high schools are "squeezed out" of
the public flagships. As the demand for access to the public flagships
surged, admission rates fell for students ranked below the top decile
(Jayson, 2003a; THECB, 2003). In 1996, the year of the Hopwood decision,
about 43-44% of freshmen enrollees at the University of Texas at
Austin (UT) and Texas A&M (A&M) ranked in the top decile of their senior
class. Three years later, this share rose modestly to 47% and 51%,
respectively, at these institutions.l Although the share of students automatically
admitted to A&M reached a plateau just over 50%, at UT the
number of top decile applicants continued to rise such that 70% of the
applicants during 2003-2004 qualified for automatic admission (Jayson,
2003b; Lavergne & Walker, 2003; Nissimov, 2003; THECB, 2003;
Wolfson, 2004).
Predictably, institutional saturation with automatically admitted students
triggered discontent among a highly vocal constituency, namely
graduates from academically competitive high schools with strong college-
going traditions who did not graduate in the top decile of their senior
class (Nissimov, 2000; Yardley, 2002).2 Several prominent critics of
H.B. 588, including Texas Governor Rick Perry (Wolfson, 2004), argued
that the "best and brightest" are leaving the state-a "brain drain" of

sorts-in response to "crowding out" of second decile students from
competitive high schools by top 10% admissions from low-performing
high schools. As the saturation of UT applicants with top 10% graduates
surpassed 70%, opponents of H.B. 588 called for its rescission on
grounds that its negative consequences outweighed the early benefits
and that the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in Grutter v. Bollingerno longer
justified the top 10% law (Flores, 2003; Glater, 2004; Irving, 2004;
Nissimov, 2003).
The "brain drain" hypothesis, which we evaluate empirically, maintains
that high-achieving students who graduate from competitive secondary
schools but fail to qualify for automatic admission to one of the
public flagships leave the state for college. Virtually all the evidence supporting
such claims derives from anecdotes about disgruntled students
rather than from a rigorous evaluation of college choice under the uniform
admission regime. Therefore, to evaluate the "brain drain" hypothesis
empirically, we address three questions about college choice using a
representative sample of Texas high school seniors whose admissions
were governed by H.B. 588. First, how does type of high school attended
influence seniors' college preferences for and enrollment in a Texas versus
non-Texas postsecondary institution? Second, how do college preferences
and enrollment decisions differ by school type for top decile graduates?
Finally, is there evidence that second decile students who
graduate from the most competitive public high schools leave the state
because they are crowded out of the two flagships?
In addition to testing the "brain drain" hypothesis, our findings are theoretically
important for the philosophical debate about what must be
equal for educational opportunity to be equal; and they are practically
relevant for the national debate about the prospects for devising race-neutral
admissions standards. President George W. Bush cited percent plans,
and the Texas plan in particular, as viable alternatives to race-conscious
admissions in the White House brief filed on behalf of Grutter and Gratz
(Jones Olson, Boyd, Clement, & Salmons, 2002a, 2002b). In the wake of
the Grutter decision, which permits a narrowly tailored consideration of
race in college admissions, the declared successes of the Texas percent
plan invigorated opponents of affirmative action to reassert the value of
percent plans as a race-neutral alternative to affirmative action.
In what follows, we first develop a classification scheme that characterizes
high schools according to their relative affluence and collegegoing
traditions. Subsequently, we formulate a strategy to test the "brain
drain" hypothesis empirically. We conclude with a brief summary of the
main findings and a discussion of the broader implications of the Texas
experience for the nation as a whole.

Testing the "Brain Drain" Hypothesis 715
The Top 10% Law Highlights
Under the top 10% law, top decile students qualify for automatic admission
to any public postsecondary institutions in Texas, but qualifying
students must complete the university's application (including essays)
and a college entrance exam (either SAT or ACT). Test scores are not
considered in the admission decision or in course placement.3 In Texas,
class rank is reported by the students' high schools, not by the university
systems, as in California. The admission guarantee is good for two years
following graduation, provided that students do not register at another
college (Leicht & Sullivan, 2000). Students who do not qualify for the
admission guarantee are admissible, within the bounds of institutional
carrying capacity, based on their overall academic record.4
For students who do not graduate in the top 10% of their class, student
merit is based on a broad range of objective and subjective criteria, including
standardized test scores, completion of required high school
curriculum, scores on two essays, demonstrated leadership qualities, extracurricular
activities, region of residence, school characteristics,
awards/honors, work experience, public service, and special circumstances
(such as socioeconomic status, family responsibilities, and
school conditions, among others) (Walker & Lavergne, 2001, p. 20). Our
multivariate models consider such factors in evaluating the "brain drain"
hypothesis.
If the Texas top 10% plan appears to be a radical change in admissions
policy, it is not, in fact. Class rank always has been seriously considered
and heavily weighed in admissions decisions at the public flagships. In
fact, before 1995, students graduating in the top decile of their class
were automatically admitted to the University of Texas at Austin
(Walker & Lavergne, 2001).5 What is "new" about the Texas college admissions
policy is the explicit de-emphasis of test scores for students
who graduate in the top decile of their class, and the explicit prohibition
of considering race and ethnicity in decisions.
Data
Evaluating the merits of the "brain drain" hypothesis requires a statistically
representative sample of senior high students across a range
of secondary schools and information about their ranked college preferences
and eventual enrollment decisions. The survey data collected
under the auspices of the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project
(THEOP) meets these requirements. In spring 2002, a representative
sample of Texas public high school seniors was surveyed (wave 1) and

716 The Journal of Higher Education
a random subsample of the senior cohort was reinterviewed (wave 2)
the following spring. The baseline sample was drawn using a two-stage
stratified sampling design. In the first stage, 62 primary sampling units
(PSUs) were randomly chosen to represent the high school-age population
in Texas. For the second stage, 108 public high schools were
randomly drawn from the universe of secondary schools that included
both 10th and 12th grades and had a senior class of 10 or more
students.6
From the sampled high schools, 13,803 seniors were interviewed
using a paper and pencil in-class survey instrument. For cost reasons,
only a subsample of 5,800 seniors, or about 42% of the original sample,
were reinterviewed one year after high school graduation. To guarantee
the maximum possible precision for Blacks and Asians, all baseline respondents
from these groups were included in the longitudinal sample;
proportionate samples of Hispanics and non-Hispanic Whites were randomly
drawn for the sample balance. Weights ensure representativeness
of the sample to the population of Texas high school seniors in 2002.
The response rate for the wave 2 interviews was 70%, and sample
weights for the follow-up interviews were recalibrated to the original
population. The major strength of the longitudinal survey design is that
it avoids selection biases inherent in other studies by asking students'
college preferences prospectively rather than retrospectively. In addition
to basic demographic, socioeconomic, and standard tracking information,
the baseline survey included a battery of questions about
college plans, including up to five rank-ordered college preferences,
whether applications were submitted, and the admission decisions.
The first follow-up survey (wave 2) recorded whether respondents actually
enrolled in college one year after high school graduation, and if
so, where.
All colleges in students' choice sets-both their stated preferences in
the baseline survey and their enrollment institutions-were assigned Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) codes. This
permits appending college characteristics to individual records, which is
necessary to classify preferences and enrollment decisions by institutional
type (e.g., junior college, four-year public or private university,
etc.) and selectivity of admissions (Niu, Tienda, & Cortes, 2006). Using
a database maintained by the Texas Education Agency, we also appended
high school attributes to individual student records in the baseline
survey. This information allows us to derive a classification scheme
of secondary schools according to their socioeconomic status and college-
going traditions.

Testing the "Brain Drain" Hypothesis 717
College Preferences and Enrollment Decisions
Because the "brain drain" hypothesis is about the barriers that hinder
students' access to the public flagships, we examine students' first college
preference and their actual enrollment decision to determine who
succeeded in realizing their college goals. Specifically, we classify students'
first college choice into six categories: (a) no college; (b) UT or
A&M; (c) other Texas four-year institutions; (d) Texas two-year institutions;
(e) non-Texas two- or four-year institutions; and (f) unspecified
preference. Enrollment decisions use these same categories without the
unspecified preference. Other selective public institutions, such as Texas
Tech, University of Houston, and University of Texas at Dallas, also recruit
students from competitive high schools who wish to remain in
cities, but the "brain drain" hypothesis is mostly focused on crowding
out of second decile graduates from the public flagships. Hence we focused
on UT and A&M.
Class Rank and High School Type
The two primary individual attributes for testing the "brain drain" hypothesis
are students' class rank and the type of high school attended.
Self-reported class rank, measured in deciles, is either known to students
or estimated by them when unknown. Rank can be based on coursework
completed either during spring semester of the junior year, or fall or
spring of the senior year, depending on the semester of application. This
partly explains why almost 20% of the college choice sample is ranked
as top decile graduates, but there is also a known upward bias in self-reported
class rank.7
To portray socioeconomic variation among secondary schools, we devised
a typology that differentiates resource-poor and affluent high
schools from those of average resources. Among affluent high schools,
we further distinguished between those with low and high college-going
traditions. Feeder high schools are a subset of the affluent schools with
very strong college-going traditions, including large numbers who historically
attended the two public flagships. Operationally, feeder high
schools are the top 20 high schools based on the absolute number of students
admitted to UT and A&M in 2000 (Tienda et al., 2003). At A&M,
the top 20 feeder high schools accounted for 15% of students admitted
in 2000, and 14% of enrolled freshmen. For UT, the corresponding figures
are both 23%. Because of the considerable overlap between the
two sets, the combined list of feeder schools represent only 28 high
schools out of a possible 1,644 public high schools in 2000 (Texas Education
Agency [TEA], 2001). Survey results reveal that feeder and other

718 The Journal of Higher Education
affluent schools are located in suburban areas around major cities in the
eastern part of the state. Not surprisingly, about two thirds of feeder
school graduates have college-educated parents and the vast majority
live in owned rather than rented homes.
Among the resource-poor high schools, we distinguished between
those with low college-going traditions that have been targeted by UT
and A&M to receive Longhorn or Century scholarships, and other poor
schools.8 These two scholarship programs were designed to enable top
decile students who attend schools with high shares of economically disadvantaged
students to enroll at the public flagships. Approximately one
third of seniors from resource-poor schools live with parents lacking a
high school education. Our five-category classification scheme enables
us to compare "feeder" high schools (as defined above), other affluent
schools, resource-poor schools, and poor schools designated for Longhorn
or Century scholarship awards with a residual category that represents
typical Texas high schools as of 2002.
Table 1 provides an overview of college preference and enrollment decisions
among Texas public high school seniors in 2002. First, nearly
three fourths of all high school graduates pursue some form of postsecondary
education. Second, college intentions and enrollment rates are
substantially higher among top decile graduates-over 90% report postsecondary
plans and actually enroll within a year of leaving high school.
Third, (non-flagship) four-year Texas public colleges and universities are
the modal college choice, as over one third of 2002 high school graduates
designated such institutions as their first preference. Fourth, one in three
top decile graduates indicated one of the flagships as their first preference
and actually enrolled there within a year of high school graduation.
Not surprisingly, feeder high school students have a very strong preference
for both the public flagships and non-Texas institutions. This is
especially so for the top 10% graduates, who are quite successful in realizing
their enrollment goals (Niu et al., 2006). Specifically, over one
third of feeder high school students who graduated in the top 10% of
their class named UT or A&M as their first college choice and almost
two thirds of these actually enrolled at one of the flagships. For second
decile feeder high school graduates, the corresponding shares are 43%
and 47%.
Estimation Strategies
To estimate how individual characteristics determine college decision-
making, the recent college choice literature uses the multinomial
logit model (Manski & Wise, 1983). We also use this approach to exam-

known to influence college choice, which includes gender,
race/ethnicity, college orientation, class rank, parental education, home
ownership, and several high school characteristics, including location
and type according to our classification scheme (Karen, 2002; McDonough,
1997). Appendix 1 provides the summary statistics for these covariates.
Maximum likelihood estimation of coefficients 3(j) provide the

outcomes at the two flagships among top 10% students across high
school types. Evidence that feeder high school students who graduate in
the second decile of their class are more likely to enroll at non-Texas institutions
than their rank counterparts who graduate from typical high
schools does not constitute proof of a fostered "brain drain" because students
may leave by choice. Fortunately, the THEOP survey allows us to
examine whether students who enroll at non-Texas institutions do so because
their preferred college is located out-of-state.

722 The Journal of Higher Education
Information about ranked preferences is crucial for testing the "brain
drain" hypothesis, which we evaluate using three empirical strategies.
First, we estimate the multinomial logit model separately by school
type, using top decile students as the reference group. Because top
decile students are privileged with guaranteed admission to the Texas
public flagships, their preference for and enrollment in a non-Texas institution
serves as the benchmark for assessing whether lower-ranked
students are crowded out. We assume that second decile students are not
more likely to enroll out-of-state than their top decile counterparts are,
which Table 1 supports. If second decile feeder high school graduates
are more likely to prefer and enroll in a non-Texas institution than are
their top decile statistical counterparts, this potentially signals a "brain
drain" due to crowding. However, if they are less or equally likely both
to prefer and to enroll at a non-Texas institution, evidence of "crowding
out" is much weaker.
Conceivably, second decile feeder high school graduates choose a
non-Texas institution as their top preference because of their perceived
lower admission chances at the public flagships. To consider this possibility,
as a second empirical strategy we cross-examine first and second
preferences among feeder high school students who graduate in the second
decile of their class. Evidence that students whose first preference is
one of the flagships actually name a non-Texas institution as their second
preference potentially indicates a "brain drain." However, if second
decile students whose first preference is a non-Texas institution name
another non-Texas institution as their second choice, then the "brain
drain" claims would appear to be groundless.
Our third and final strategy to test the "brain drain" hypothesis is essentially
a "reality check." Specifically, we investigate the likelihood
that second decile feeder school graduates who prefer attending one of
the flagships actually succeed in realizing their goal. Evidence that most
of these students actually enroll at a non-Texas institution would support
the "brain drain" hypothesis. However, if most of these students succeed
in enrolling at one of the flagships, then claims that highly deserving
students are being crowded out of Texas public institutions are empirically
unfounded, media anecdotes notwithstanding.

ence of school type on first college preference and the enrollment
decisions, respectively. Four years after H.B. 588 went into effect, graduates
from feeder high schools retainedp referentiala ccess to the Texas flagships.
Compared with graduates from typical Texas high schools, feeder
high school graduates are 2.2 times as likely to prefer UT or A&M over
other Texas four-year colleges and universities, but even more likely-3
times as likely-to actually enroll at one of the public flagships the year
following high school graduation. At the same time, they are 2.8 times as
likely as the average graduate to prefer a non-Texas institution, but their
odds of matriculatingo ut-of-statei s lower-only 2 times as likely.
Graduatesf rom Longhorn/Centuryh igh schools are no more likely than
are typical high school students to express a preference for and actually
matriculate at UT or A&M relative to other four-year Texas institutions.
Possibly because of heavy recruitment by admissions personnel, Longhor/
Century high school seniors were 30% more likely to express a preference
for an out-of-state institution over other Texas four-year institutions.
That these students are no more likely to prefer a two-year college
over a non-flagship four-year college, but are 60% more likely to matriculate
there, attests to the persisting financial barriers to college access.
Seniors from other resource-affluent high schools also enjoy preferential
access to the two flagships, but to a lesser extent than do graduates
from feeder high schools. However, students from resource-poor schools
are clearly disadvantaged in their access to the two public flagships. Not
only are they about half as likely to prefer UT or A&M over other Texas
four-year institutions, but their odds of actually matriculating at one of
these institutions is even lower-only about 40% as likely as graduates
from typical Texas high schools. Contrary to claims proliferated in the
print media, these results demonstrate that feeder high school students
enjoy a substantial advantage in their access to the Texas flagships, even
four years after H.B. 588 was put into effect.
College Access for Top Decile Students
Because H.B. 588 guarantees top 10% graduates admission to any
Texas institution, there is much less variation in enrollment decisions by
school type compared with preferences. Top 10% seniors from feeder
high schools are twice as likely as their rank counterparts who graduate
from typical Texas high schools to prefer attending one of the public
flagships, but they have even stronger preferences-3.6 times as highfor
out-of-state institutions compared with other Texas four-year institutions.
Conditional on admission, their enrollment odds are equal across
institutional types.

resource-poor high schools are as likely as graduates from typical high
schools are to pursue two-year or non-college options. However, the results
for Longhorn/Century schools reflect a strong selection process.
Compared with top-ranked graduates from typical Texas high schools,
top decile students who graduate from a Longhorn or Century high
school are 3.7 times as likely to opt for no college, 4.8 times as likely not
to enroll at any postsecondary institution, and 3.3 times as likely to enroll
at a two-year Texas college. Top 10% graduates form Longhorn/Century
high schools who both prefer and actually enroll at a four-year institution
are a very selective subset of this high-performing pool. Thus, the seemingly
equal enrollment probabilities among high-performing students
across school types result because a large segment of the eligible pool
from Longhorn/Centurys chools is effectively excluded.
Top-ranked students from other resource-affluent schools share similar
preferences to feeder high school graduates. However, their strong
preferences for the public flagships and non-Texas institutions are
equalized in their matriculation behavior, as they are equally as likely as
their statistical counterparts who graduated from a typical Texas high
school to enroll either at a Texas flagship or at a non-Texas institution.
However, top-ranked graduates from resource-poor high schools are
only 40% as likely to prefer and only 20% as likely to enroll at one of
the public flagships.
Second Decile Feeder School Graduates and the "Brain
Drain" Hypothesis
The last set of results in the upper and lower panels of Table 2 report
high school variation in college choices of second decile studentsthose
allegedly at high risk of being crowded out of competitive Texas
colleges because of H.B. 588. Second decile graduates from feeder high
schools have very strong preferences for both the Texas public flagships
and non-Texas institutions. In fact, these students enjoyed preferential
access to both institutional types. Compared with second decile students
from typical Texas high schools, second decile feeder high school students
are 3.9 times as likely to prefer one of the flagships over other
four-year Texas institutions, and their matriculation odds are even
higher-4.5 times as likely. Moreover, they are 4.4 times as likely as
their rank counterparts who attend typical Texas high schools to prefer
an out-of-state school to another four-year Texas institution, but their
matriculation odds are slightly lower-3.8 times. Of course, their higher
preferences for and enrollment odds at out-of-state institutions do not
constitute prima facia evidence of a "brain drain" because they may actually
prefer a non-Texas college, as we demonstrate below.

726 The Journal of Higher Education
The college-going behavior of second decile feeder high school graduates
is especially germane for assessing the extent to which qualified
students who graduate from highly competitive high schools are
"crowded out" of the public flagships. Table 3 reports multinomial logit
results estimating the influence of class rank on first college preference
and enrollment decisions among all seniors, and separately by high
school type. The reference group is top decile students, whose decisions
to leave the state serve as the benchmark for appraising a possible "brain
drain." Results for all Texas graduates show that, on average, second
decile students are less likely than top decile graduates are to prefer and
to enroll at non-Texas institutions. Compared with top 10% students,
they and second decile seniors from other resource-affluent schools
probably lack the academic qualifications for admission to the most selective
colleges and universities outside of Texas.
However, this generalization does not apply to feeder high school
graduates. In fact, seniors who graduate from feeder high schools ranked
in the second 10% of their class are equally likely as their top decile
counterparts to prefer and to enroll out of state. We suspect that the demanding
curriculum and strong college-going traditions of these high
schools enable second decile feeder high school students to compete for
admission at the most selective colleges and universities outside Texas.
This result is a vital test of the "brain drain" hypothesis. To confirm our
interpretation, we examine the list of out-of-state institutions attended
by second decile feeder high school graduates (Appendix 2). The list includes
the most competitive private schools, such as the University of
Southern California, Washington University in St. Louis, and Brigham
Young University, as well as competitive state public institutions in
neighboring states, such as the University of Oklahoma and the University
of Colorado.
Of course, it is also conceivable that second decile feeder high school
graduates would be less likely to prefer and to enroll out-of-state in the
absence of the top 10% law. In other words, owing to a perceived lower
chance of admission to the public flagships, second decile graduates
from feeder high schools who identify an out-of-state institution as their
first preference may actually prefer to remain in Texas and attend either
UT or A&M. To examine this possibility, Table 4 cross-classifies the
first and second preferences for Texas college-bound high school seniors,
providing more detailed breakdowns for feeder school graduates.
Only about half of college-bound seniors report a second institutional
preference, yet the cross-classification of first and second choices reveals
a strong inclination for Texas high school graduates to remain in
the state.

The upper panel reveals that most students who identify a Texas institution
(flagships, other Texas four-year institutions or Texas 2-year institutions)
as their first preference choose another Texas four-year institution
as their alternative. Evidence that students who identify a non-Texas
institution as their first choice split their second option between other
Texas four-year institution versus another out-of-state institution, with a
slight inclination for the latter, undermines claims of the "brain drain"
hypothesis.
The lower panel indicates that feeder high school graduates have
strong preferences for out-of-state institutions. For example, almost half
of top decile seniors who graduate from feeder high schools and identify
either UT or A&M as their first preference name an out-of-state institution
as their alternative. Moreover-and contrary to the predictions of
the brain-drain hypothesis-the majority of feeder high school students
who identify an out-of-state institution as their first preference choose
another out-of-state institution as their second alternative. Although
57% of top decile graduates do not name a second preference, 28%
name another out-of-state institution, and 14% name UT or A&M as
their second choice. The corresponding shares for students ranked in the

second decile are 56%, 29%, and 7%, respectively. That most of these
students select yet another out-of-state institution as an alternative appears
to indicate that students choose to leave the state rather than being
crowded out. More top decile than second decile students select a public
flagship as their second choice, probably because admission to non-
Texas institutions is uncertain (Niu et al., 2006). Essentially, H.B. 588 is
an admission insurance policy for top decile graduates who set their
sights on non-Texas institutions.
The "brain drain" hypothesis partly rests on the enrollment outcomes
of second decile feeder school students who prefer UT or A&M but who
are potentially "crowded out" by top decile graduates from less competitive
high schools. To address this question, Table 5 cross-classifies first
college preference, recorded during the senior year, and actual enrollment
the following year, based on the follow-up interview. For the state
as a whole, 62% of all Texas seniors who specify UT or A&M as their
first choice actually enroll at these institutions the year after high school
graduation. Compared with the most selective institutions nationally,
this represents a high probability of enrollment, and it is consistent with
the published 2002 institutional admissions at UT and A&M.

730 The Journal of Higher Education
Of special relevance for the "brain drain" hypothesis, these tabulations
show that, compared with the average Texas senior who attends a typical
high school, feeder high school graduates are more successful (74%) in
realizing their goal of enrolling at UT or A&M. All top decile feeder high
school students whose top college choice was one of the public flagships
actually matriculated there the following fall. Moreover, and contrary to
media anecdotes that second decile feeder school students denied access
to UT or A&M leave the state, our data show that 96% of second decile
feeder high school graduates who identify UT or A&M as their first preference
actually matriculate there in the following fall. The remainder matriculates
at other Texas four-year and two-year institutions, and only trivial
shares enroll out of state. Based on these data, it is difficult to argue
that H.B. 588 has undermined second decile feeder school students' access
to the public flagships. If anything, the very few second decile feeder
school students who are denied admission to one of the flagships enroll at
other Texas institutions, not at out-of-state schools. Of course, it is conceivable
that prior to H.B. 588 even higher shares of students would name
UT or A&M as their top college choice and actually matriculate, but this
begs the question about whether even higher levels of advantaged access
to the public flagships was justified in the first place.
Among seniors aspiring to attend non-Texas institutions, only about
half realize their college goal, but this is true of students nationally because
most states give admission priority to their own residents. Preference
for in-state residents is particularly high in Texas, where by law,
80% of the student body at public institutions must be Texas residents.
Of students who prefer other Texas four-year and two-year institutions,
66% and 71% succeed in enrolling there. At the same time, 13% of students
aspiring to attend non-Texas institutions do not enroll anywhere,
compared with 5% and 7%, respectively, for those whose first preference
is UT, A&M, or another Texas four-year institution. Moreover, one
in four students who prefer a Texas two-year institution fails to enroll
there or anywhere. This exposes a significant problem in Texas higher
education-namely, the large numbers of college-eligible students who
do not enroll at any institution of higher education.
The difficulty of actualizing out-of-state enrollment plans also affects
students from feeder high schools, among whom less than half of those
seeking admission to non-Texas institutions actually succeed in enrolling.
Although students ranked in the top two deciles of their graduating
class are more successful enrolling out of state (about 60% realize
non-Texas college plans), this is significantly lower than their success
enrolling at Texas institutions. Less than 10% of top decile feeder school
students who identify an out-of-state institution as their first preference
actually matriculate at one of the flagships, lending support to our claim

that UT and A&M serve as backup insurance against the odds of rejection
from a selective non-Texas institution. However, for second decile
graduates from feeder high schools, the public flagships no longer provide
back-up insurance. Surely, this is the main source of dissatisfaction
with H.B. 588, but it hardly constitutes evidence of "crowding out"
given that second decile feeder high school graduates enjoy appreciably
higher access to the public flagships than do second decile graduates
from typical Texas high schools.
Conclusion
We examined the college preferences and enrollment decisions of a
representative sample of Texas high school seniors who graduated in
2002, four years after the top 10% law was implemented. We find that
feeder school students enjoy a substantial advantage in their access to
the Texas public flagships, and that conditional on admission, top 10%
graduates' enrollment odds are similar to those of their counterparts
from typical Texas high schools. Most importantly, and in contrast to
claims based on anecdotes, empirical evidence does not support the
"brain drain" hypothesis. Specifically, feeder high school students
ranked in the top two deciles of their senior class have strong preference
for out-of-state institutions, and second decile feeder high school students
are no more likely than are their top decile counterparts to prefer
and to enroll out of state. Furthermore, most feeder high school students
ranked in the top 20% of their class who identify a non-Texas institution
as their first college preference choose yet another out-of-state institution
as their second choice. Virtually all second decile feeder school students
who identify one of the public flagships as their first preference
enroll there the following fall. Overall, our examination of ranked preferences
leads us to conclude that students who enroll at out-of-state institutions
do so largely by choice, within the constraints of admission,
affordability, and opportunity to leave the state. In fact, students' ranked
preferences indicate that even greater numbers would leave the state if
they were admitted to their preferred non-Texas institution.
Throughout this study, we assume that students' top-ranked institution
is their preferred choice, but it is conceivable that an environment of constrained
choices may lead some students to rank out-of-state institutions
higher than Texas institutions. In other words, the distinction between
forced and voluntary departures from the state may be less defined. Even
though we cannot perfectly distinguish between choosing to leave or
being squeezed out of state, the "brain drain" appears to be chimerical.
Our findings lead us to question the broad educational mission of
public institutions, particularly in Texas, where relatively low tuition

732 The Journal of Higher Education
makes college accessible to students from a broad range of income
strata. Whether by design or default, the Texas top 10% law has heightened
awareness of the criteria used to allocate slots at public institutions
of varying selectivity: How should equity considerations be weighted in
devising criteria for leveling the playing field in the future?
The bold Texas experiment with a uniform admission system has
many lessons for the national struggle to devise criteria for broadening
access to higher education in a highly unequal playing field. First, the
success of H.B. 588 in diversifying the ethno-racial composition of the
freshman class depends both on the presence of a large minority population
and on pervasive segregation (Tienda & Niu, 2006), a condition
which few states can meet (Orfield & Lee, 2004; Tienda, 2001).
Second, the Texas experiment has again challenged the premise that
standardized test scores are important predictors of college success. By
admitting students without regard to ACT or SAT scores, Texas colleges
and universities have reaffirmed the superiority of performance-based
over test-based merit criteria. For example, at UT, top decile students not
only outperformt heir lower-rankedc ounterpartsw ith test scores 200-300
points higher (Faulkner, 2000, 2002), but they also defy predictions that
high-achieving students from underperforming schools are destined for
failure because they are ill-prepared for college level academic work.
A third powerful lesson is that the success of percent plans in broadening
educational opportunity beyond high school requires strong outreach
efforts to encourage rank-eligible students to apply for admission
(Walker & Lavergne, 2001). Having refused to consider race in college
admissions, administrators at A&M appreciate that outreach activities
are more effective than a uniform admission guarantee in broadening
college access to underrepresented groups (Spencer, 2004). However,
even with strong outreach efforts, Texas flagships have not equalized the
enrollment odds of students from high schools with low college-going
traditions compared with students from typical high schools.
This raises a final dilemma for higher education generally-namely,
the rising demographic pressure on higher education as the children of
baby boomers reach college age. Nationally, but even more dramatically
in Texas, higher educational opportunities have not kept pace with the
rapid demographic growth. To some extent, the admissions squeeze at
the selective Texas public institutions merely reflects the growing demand
for access to the most competitive institutions when most of the
growth in postsecondary opportunities has occurred in two-year colleges.
This squeeze only accentuates the challenge of broadening access
to higher education while maintaining standards and rewarding academic
achievement.

Testing the "Brain Drain" Hypothesis 737
Notes
1Anticipating an enrollment squeeze as the demand for automatic admission rose, in
2000, UT President Larry Faulkner temporarily increased the size of the freshman class,
but this increase was rescinded in 2002 as the university exceeded its carrying capacity
(see Faulkner, 2000; Jayson, 2003b).
2In a highly provocative article published in the New York Times Education Life Supplement
(April 14, 2002), Jim Yardley reported on twin sisters who were graduating
from an elite Texas public high school. One twin was admitted automatically to UT, but
her sister was initially deferred, and she did not get in to her preferred major when she
was later admitted. Noting that both were admitted to University of North Carolina and
both were committed to attend the same institution, Yardley implied the "brain drain"
hypothesis. Subsequent allegations have been more direct.
3SAT I and ACT tests are not used in course placement decisions, but SAT II and
other tests may be so used (G. Lavergne, personal communication, January 16, 2003).
4Institutions actually have more control over the overall enrollment cap than they
concede because they can modify the number of transfer or graduate students, but the
overall carrying capacity is bound by physical infrastructure.
5In 1996, the practice of automatically admitting applicants who were ranked in the
top 10% of their class was changed because the Faculty Council and the University Admissions
Committee wanted a rigorous admission process that was more consistent with
a selective school. Essays were used for the first time in 1996. These changes were underway
independent of the court case about affirmative action.
60f these, three schools were ineligible because they were special-needs schools, and
98 of the remaining 105 schools cooperated by permitting in-class administration of the
survey (86) or providing student addresses (12) so that a mail survey could be administered.
Only two of the non-cooperating schools were outright refusals and the remaining
five were long-term recalcitrant. The school-level cooperation rate of 93.3% (98/105) is
considered outstanding.
7Higher-rankeds tudents are more likely to know their class rank, to state an institutional
preference, and to actually enroll in college, which also contributes to the disproportionate
share classified as top decile graduates among college-bound students, but so
too does upward bias in response error.
8Longhorn and Century schools were targeted by UT and A&M, respectively, based
on two criteria: high shares of economically disadvantaged students and low collegegoing
traditions. Many of these schools have high concentrations of minority students.
See Goodman, 2003.
