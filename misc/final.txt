(1) might, frequency is 35. Eg.
a) Why this might have occurred is worthy of investigation. (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)
b) And of course there are always 4-5 to an office so it might be crowded and a student wants to have a personal conversation with me. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(2) may, frequency is 202. Eg.
a) However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use. (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) As suggested by Bandura (1977, 1986), these conversations may serve to inspire students to work with greater levels of effort or to try new experiences, to normalize feelings of inadequacy or assuage fears, or to learn vicariously through the experiences of others. (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(3) maybe, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) ­ I­ guess ­maybe ­it’s ­just ­been ­easier ­for ­me­ to­ do­ things­ every­ day.­I ­guess ­I ­haven’t­ really ­truly ­thought ­a ­lot ­about ­that. (Discourses of Whiteness: White Students at Catholic women’s Colleges (Dis)engaging Race, The Journal of Higher Education,­ Vol.­84,­ No.­1­)

(4) perhaps, frequency is 21. Eg.
a) Based on our findings, we conclude that the geographic context is less important as an influence on the dropping of declining fields than to the adoption of new fields (Brint et al., 2011), perhaps because drops expand and redistribute niche space geographically among those institutions continuing to offer declining programs. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)
b) Respect of ideas is perhaps the most important currency in academia and plays a substantial role in graduate progress, letters of recommendation, and future job prospects. (Graduate Students’ Perceptions of Their Advisors: Is There Systematic Disadvantage in Mentorship?, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6 )

(5) possible, frequency is 23. Eg.
a) Chairs not only intentionally housed faculty but also scheduled courses far in advanee so that NTTF had appropriate time to prepare for courses, helping consolidate part-time teachers so that they could teach at as few places as possible and not be impacted by eommuting. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) Part-time faculty experienced the harshest aspects of the negative cultures and could not shield themselves the way some long-time, full-time NTTF were able to, by becoming as autonomous and isolated as possible or by creating connections to tenure-track faculty who might protect them from the harshest policies that impeded their performance. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(6) about, frequency is 118. Eg.

b) As second-class citizens, almost all NTTF described how at times their requests for support were not met, and students ended up suffering. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(8) nearly, frequency is 12. Eg.
a) The number of colleges and universities in our study population increased by 12% during the 35-year period, from 1,263 to 1,416, while the number of baccalaureate degrees these institutions awarded annually increased from nearly 800,000 to more than 1.3 million. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(9) apparent, frequency is 4. Eg.
a) However, there are differences in motivations behind this apparent agreement over spending priorities. (The Political Dynamics of Higher Education Policy, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) While many universities and departments are making strides to further diversify the make-up of their faculty and graduate student body, parity is far from apparent. (Graduate Students’ Perceptions of Their Advisors: Is There Systematic Disadvantage in Mentorship?, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6 )

(10) appear/appears/appeared, frequency is 19. Eg.
a) A third outcome or finding of this study is identification of a host of policies and practices that appear to shape willingness, capacity, and opportunity to perform and are characteristics of the learning culture. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) Based on our results, it appears that persistence rates may be improved and the educational pipeline strengthened with programs fostering social integration, and to a lesser extent, academic integration, whereas concern over economic competitiveness and workforce development may best be addressed with programs designed to promote critical aspects of student learning. (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(11) around, frequency is 15. Eg.
a) We organized this study around the central hypothesis that student learning during college positively affects persistence, above and beyond background characteristics, measures of social, human, and financial capital, and other confounding influences such as postsecondary institutional environment, and academic and social integration. (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) Students structure their college experiences around choice of college major, and so field of study is an additional key factor shaping eventual graduation (Leppel, 2001). (Fewer Diplomas for Men: The Influence of College Experiences on the Gender Gap in College Graduation, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(12) assume/assumes/assumed, frequency is 9. Eg.
a) If we assume that error is randomly distributed, any error will tend to truncate the amount of variance we explain in our models. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(14) certain (to a certain degree/extent/..;in certain ways) , frequency is 11. Eg.
a) According to Martin, there is no single reality of culture but individual perceptions may coalesce around certain similar values or norms, particularly in subgroups that have the same experience. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) Gappa et al. (2007) proposed that certain characteristics affect the performance of faculty: employment equity. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(15) could, frequency is 36. Eg.
a) The chair made it a point to try to improve salaries to market rate, to schedule enough courses so that NTTF could receive benefits, and to collaboratively schedule part-timers with enough advanced notice so they could sync with other campuses. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) Talk about improving student leaming! ￼Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty 177 Within the learning culture, there was often recognition that each small decision could have a significant impact on learning. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(16) doubt/doubts v., frequency is 1. Eg.
a) Apart from the serious problems experienced by European languages and literatures, we doubt that scholars will see especially worrisome signs of academic decay in the changes we found during the period covered by our study. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(17) estimate/estimates/estimated v., frequency is 24. Eg.
a) Based on the loss of statistical significance in the estimated net effects of leadership and the decrease in effect size of grades (B = 0.266, Delta-p = 0.009, p < 0.01), the combined model estimates provide evidence that academic and social integration moderate the effects of these two learning measures on persistence. (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) Indeed, Buchman and DiPrete (2006) estimate that approximately one third of the gender gap in graduation among White students is attributable to differences in college grades. (Fewer Diplomas for Men: The Influence of College Experiences on the Gender Gap in College Graduation, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(18) feel/feels/felt, frequency is 13. Eg.
a) In some instances, they felt culture was different between these groups (the findings about felt culture are the topic of another paper and not a major focus here given space constraints). (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) In the learning culture, chairs were more likely to ereate a mechanism for providing this information, so that lecturers felt confident and had accurate information. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(19) frequently, frequency is 5. Eg.
a) As a result, the impact of legislators’ ideological preferences on spending decisions varies with political institutions, and outcomes frequently diverge from the preferences of the median voter (Besley & Case, 2003). (The Political Dynamics of Higher Education Policy, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) Existing literature has indicated that faculty of color frequently face increased demands on the part of students of color who seek them as mentors, either for their specialty areas or because they may personally understand their experiences. (Graduate Students’ Perceptions of Their Advisors: Is There Systematic Disadvantage in Mentorship?, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6 )

(20) generally, frequency is 7. Eg.
a) They were more likely to consider departmental staff helpful and courteous and chairs as generally open to speak with NTTF. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) These programs, which generally attract students who have declared or plan to declare a STEM major, provide opportunities for students to participate in field trips, courses, research projects, and other activities that promote involvement in STEM. (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(21) in general, frequency is 5. Eg.
a) In general, these studies point to the higher likelihood of persistence for students who receive financial aid, although some studies have found differential effects for financial aid based on distinctions among race (Furr & Elling, 2002), socioeconomic status, and type of aid awarded (Paulsen & St. (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) To address whether men in general are less likely to graduate or whether particular subgroups of men are exceptionally less likely to graduate and so bring down the average for men, I tested a series of interactions between being male and SES and race and ethnicity. (Fewer Diplomas for Men: The Influence of College Experiences on the Gender Gap in College Graduation, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(22) indicate/indicates/indicated, frequency is 46. Eg.
a) I measure college major with three dummy variables based on the gender composition of field of study—one indicates majoring in the male dominated fields of engineering, math, or the physical sciences; the second indicates majoring in the female dominated fields of education or health; and the final indicates majoring in the relatively more gender balanced arts and sciences and other majors. (Fewer Diplomas for Men: The Influence of College Experiences on the Gender Gap in College Graduation, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) According to potter’s (2006) study, for example, only 11 of the 37 states indicated that state master plans included capital spending. (The Determinants of state spending on Higher education: How Capital Project Funding Differs from General Fund Appropriations, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 3)

(23) most likely, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) Today, not all institutions with commitments to the liberal arts are high-status; instead, small religiously-affiliated colleges are among the most likely to maintain these commitments (Brint, Proctor, Murphy, Turk-Bicakci, & Hanneman, 2009). (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(24) more likely, frequency is 46. Eg.
a) Similar patterns have emerged in examining the effects of gender, with some studies finding females more likely to enroll (Braxton, Bray et al., 2000; Bray et al., 1999), ... (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) These studies suggest that women may be more likely to gravitate to advisors who provide affective forms of support. (Graduate Students’ Perceptions of Their Advisors: Is There Systematic Disadvantage in Mentorship?, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6 )

(25) least likely, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) We also show that fields decline in several distinct ways, and we show the characteristics of institutions that are most and least likely to drop declining fields. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(26) less likely, frequency is 43. Eg.
a) General fund appropriations are more often formula-driven and incremental; by comparison, state capital expenditure processes vary more widely and are less likely to be formula-driven and guided by statewide master plans (Manns, 2003; Manns & Katsinas, 2006; Potter, 2006). (The Determinants of state spending on Higher education: How Capital Project Funding Differs from General Fund Appropriations, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 3)
b) However, the observed gender gap in graduation among students who entered through four-year institutions is slightly larger than all postsecondary entrants, and males are 22% less likely to graduate than females. (Fewer Diplomas for Men: The Influence of College Experiences on the Gender Gap in College Graduation, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(27) likely (without least, more, less, most), frequency is 25. Eg.
a) As compared to public institutions, private institutions, with their higher tuitions and typically stronger endowments, would seem likely to be more interested in preserving traditional arts and sciences fields. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)
b) Notes • It should be noted that four year institutions—like Masters I—are relying heavily on NTTF with close to 40% of faculty nationally being NTTF within this sector, likely higher now given budget problems (Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006). (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(28) unlikely, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) The importance of STEM education to our nation’s collective prosperity seems unlikely to abate. (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(29) largely, frequency is 11. Eg.
a) Constructivism also suggests that human beings largely have an accurate understanding of their own experience, particularly issues they are close to (Crotty, 2001; Stake, 1997). (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) First, L/L programs largely cater to first-year populations, so they represent the largest proportion of our sample (Inkelas, Brower, & Associates, 2008). (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(30) mainly, frequency is 8. Eg.
a) The list qualifies the conclusions of some early scholars of declining fields that these fields are concentrated among those studied mainly by women, among those serving disadvantaged populations (Slaughter, 1993) or among those located in the humanities (see, e.g., Delbanco, 1999) (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)
b) They were neither populated primarily by women nor mainly served disadvantaged populations. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(31) mostly, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) In the neutral culture, NTTF are typically not actively disrespected as they are in the destructive culture; rather, they are mostly ignored. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(32) often, frequency is 64. Eg.
a) For each campus, prior to interviews I reviewed the institutional website, key documents including self-study for aecreditation that often spoke to working conditions for NTTF, strategic plans, faculty handbooks, union contracts, and departmental websites and materials. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) In sum, each one of the four perspectives we used to investigate the characteristics of colleges and universities that drop declining fields received some support, but support was inconsistent and often weak for explanations based on demographic composition. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(33) on the whole, frequency is 0

(34) ought, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) In addition, the lack of findings between many of the measured dimensions of student learning used in the study and persistence suggests that the prevailing definitions of institutional quality ought to extend beyond enrollment measures in order to take into account learning as an essential determinant of quality. (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(35) plausible, frequency is 2. Eg.
a) One plausible explanation for this finding is that women of color may seek out minority and/or female faculty who they believe will recognize, understand, and appreciate their raced/gendered academic and personal struggles (Crawford & Smith, 2005; few, Stephens, & Rouse-Arnett, 2003). (Graduate Students’ Perceptions of Their Advisors: Is There Systematic Disadvantage in Mentorship?, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6 )
b) Selection effects, a perennial problem in non-equivalent group designs, are a plausible cause: if non-STEM-L/L participants were less committed to earning a STEM degree than were their STEM L/L peers, attenuation in the non-STEML/L programs’ influence may have occurred. (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(36) presumable, frequency is 0

(37) presumably, frequency is 2. Eg.
a) Next, they estimated citizen ideology in each district (both house and senate districts) of a state using the ideology score for the district’s incumbent, the estimated score for a challenger (or hypothetical challenger) to the incumbent, and election results that presumably reflect ideological divisions in the electorate. (The Determinants of state spending on Higher education: How Capital Project Funding Differs from General Fund Appropriations, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 3)
b) Consistent with our initial hypotheses, L/L programs, compared to traditional residence halls (and presumably off-campus residences), have the capacity to enhance the quality of students’ peer and faculty interactions and deepen their sense of social support, which in turn influence factors which bear directly upon vocational choice. (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(38) probable, frequency is 0

(39) probably, frequency is 1. Eg.
a) These trends are probably largely transferable to other four-year public Masters 1 institutions. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(40) quite, frequency is 6. Eg.
a) The overall institution also affects the culture and, depending on the institutional type, this influence can be strong (such as in community colleges) or quite weak (such as within large comprehensive institutions and universities). (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) Our new chair does Twitter and social media and really tries to communicate quite a bit. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(41) rather (not ”rather than”), frequency is 9. Eg.
a) Rather, instrumental advisors seek input from their students. (Graduate Students’ Perceptions of Their Advisors: Is There Systematic Disadvantage in Mentorship?, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6 )
b) We argue that decline is not a single process, but rather several distinct processes involving (a) differential propensities to offer fields among new schools as compared to schools that fail during a period, (b) the number of new as compared to failed schools, and (c) the number of drops and adoptions of fields among schools that persist throughout a period. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(42) roughly, frequency is 4. Eg.
a) Asian and Middle Eastern languages and literatures grew during the period (Brint et al., 2010), while foreign language requirements as an element of general education remained roughly constant (Brint et al., 2009). (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)
b) Roughly half of the original sample were randomly selected and administered the Moral Reasoning assessment (n = 1,265), while the entire sample of participating students were administered the remaining assessments (n = 2,439). (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(43) seem/seems/seemed, frequency is 28. Eg.
a) Although this variation in capital expenditure procedures seems to emphasize political influences, studies of higher education general fund appropriations have shown political factors related to party control, organizational structure, and interest group activity to be significant determinants of state spending for higher education (Archibald & Feldman, 2006; McLendon, Hearn, & Mohker, 2009; Tandberg, 2010a, 2010b). (The Determinants of state spending on Higher education: How Capital Project Funding Differs from General Fund Appropriations, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 3)
b) As compared to public institutions, private institutions, with their higher tuitions and typically stronger endowments, would seem likely to be more interested in preserving traditional arts and sciences fields. (Declining Academic Fields in U.S. Four-Year Colleges and Universities, 1970–2006, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 4)

(44) seemingly, frequency is 5. Eg.
a) they argued that the seemingly subtle policy differences between performance funding and performance budgeting were, in fact, substantively different, so we should not be surprised that variables affect adoption differently. (The Determinants of state spending on Higher education: How Capital Project Funding Differs from General Fund Appropriations, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 3)
b) As a result, the research literature does not rise to the practical significance of capital spending on higher education, which includes: the substantial gross spending on higher education capital projects, the sizeable share of higher education projects of all state capital spending, and the variation in the process used to determine capital spending as compared to general appropriations for higher education, which seemingly leads to a more political process for capital expenditures. (The Determinants of state spending on Higher education: How Capital Project Funding Differs from General Fund Appropriations, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 3)

(45) should(表猜测), frequency is 43. Eg.
a) conceptually distinct but mutually reinforcing outcomes that collectively explained what students should learn as a result of going to college (AAC&U, 2007). (Learning’s Weak Link to Persistence, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)
b) Future research should also explore whether college experiences contributed to this trend over time. (Fewer Diplomas for Men: The Influence of College Experiences on the Gender Gap in College Graduation, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 6)

(46) sometimes, frequency is 4. Eg.
a) The uncollaborative and late scheduling resulted in exhausted faculty who risked being late for class and sometimes less prepared than they hoped. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)
b) In terms of capacity to perform, within the destructive culture, NTTF discussed how hiring is done with little thought, is very unsystematic, and sometimes even illegal practices are used. (Departmental Cultures and Non-Tenure-Track Faculty: Willingness, Capacity, and Opportunity to Perform at Four-Year Institutions, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 84, No. 2)

(47) somewhat, frequency is 3. Eg.
a) The dependent variable (Dv) was represented by a single item (“How likely is it that you will complete a degree in [your major]”), with a five-point Likert-type response scale (“not at all likely; somewhat likely; not sure; likely; very likely”). (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)
b) After calculating the totality of effects in the hypothesized model (that is, both direct and indirect effects) of L/L participation on the Dv, a somewhat different picture emerged (see Table 4). (Supporting Students’ Intentions to Persist in STEM Disciplines: The Role of Living-Learning Programs Among Other Social-Cognitive Factors, The Journal of Higher Education, Vol. 83, No. 3)

(48) suggest/suggests/suggested (说明,暗示,非“建议”), frequency is 56. Eg.
a) Since the gender gap widens after conditioning on social integration, and more men than women play sports while men participate in fewer social and academic clubs, these results suggest that it is the higher involvement of men in sports that suppresses the magnitude of the gender gap in graduation.
